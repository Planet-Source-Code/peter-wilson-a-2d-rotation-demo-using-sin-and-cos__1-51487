=======================
A 2D Rotation Demo v1.0
=======================
This VB code graphically shows the relationship between Sine and Cosine when drawing a cirlce. In my humble opinion, I think drawing a circle is the first thing all graphics programmers need to learn. Although it may look like I'm just plotting a single dot in a cirlce, there is another way of looking at this. You could say I am rotating the dot around it's origin. This is exactly the sort of code you will need to rotate a space ship around it's origin, ala 'Asteroids' style.


If you have any questions then send me an e-mail and I'll try to help where I can.
